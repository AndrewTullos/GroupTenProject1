ser Story for a Timed Playlist Generator App Linked to a Route Planner
Title
As a user, I want the app to generate a timed playlist that matches the duration of my travel route so that I can have a seamless music experience while traveling.

Actors
User (Driver, Passenger)
App System
GPS/Route Planner
Music Library (Local or Cloud-Based)
Preconditions
User must have the app installed on their device.
User has a stable internet connection or has previously downloaded offline maps (for the GPS/Route Planner) and music.
User must have given necessary permissions for the app to access location and music library.
Main Flow
Start Route Planning: The user opens the app and starts by planning a route using the built-in GPS/Route Planner.

Calculate Duration: The app calculates the estimated time to reach the destination based on current traffic and road conditions.

Music Preferences: The app asks the user for their music preferences, such as genre, mood, or artists if this data is not already saved.

Generate Playlist: The app algorithmically generates a playlist based on user preferences, and the playlist has a total duration that closely matches the estimated travel time.

Review and Edit: The user has the option to review the generated playlist and make any edits, such as adding or removing songs.

Start Journey: User starts the planned route on the GPS, and the playlist starts playing automatically.

Mid-Route Changes: If there are any delays or changes in the travel route, the app dynamically updates the playlist to match the new estimated time of arrival.

Arrival: The playlist ends around the same time as the user reaches their destination.

History and Feedback: The app saves this playlist for future reference and asks for feedback on the music experience.

Alternate Flows
Offline Mode: If the user is in an area with poor connectivity, the app should be able to work with offline maps and a pre-downloaded music library to provide the same functionality.

Manual Playlist: The user can opt to create their own timed playlist without using the app's algorithmic suggestions.

Postconditions
The user reaches their destination while having experienced a music journey that was in sync with the travel time.

The app collects data on user preferences for improving future playlist suggestions.

Exceptions
If the GPS or Route Planner is unable to function, the playlist generation feature should notify the user of this limitation.

If the travel time extends far beyond the initially estimated time, the app will either loop the playlist or prompt the user to generate a new one.

Acceptance Criteria
The app successfully calculates the route and estimated travel time.
A playlist is generated that closely matches the estimated travel time.
User should be able to edit the playlist.
The playlist should adapt to any changes in the travel route.
User feedback is collected for future improvements.
