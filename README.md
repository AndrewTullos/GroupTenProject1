# Track Tracer: Route & Rhythm

## Description

Track Tracer is an fresh new application that fuses navigation with music, ensuring your journey is always jogging.

- **What was your motivation?**
  Drives, runs, strolls, walks; life sounds better with music. And nothing brings closure to a route more than ending a song right as you end your route. Track Tracer was born from this desire.

- **Why did you build this project?**
  To create a seamless experience for anyone who wants to optimize their travel or exercise routes with music, turning every journey into a expertly-timed playlist.

- **What problem does it solve?**
  Eliminates the headache and time requirement of creating, pausing, interrupting a playlist.

- **What did you learn?**
  Integration of two distinct APIs, understanding the blend of two different API's, and learning how to two separate ideas create a third.
